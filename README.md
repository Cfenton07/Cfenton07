- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cfenton07
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about coding and building applications in the CI/CD pipeline to help me better prepare for a role of being a Solutions architect in the cloud.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AAWS Cloud technology and Networking and I have already obtained a couple of certifications from the AWS platform.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project with any person who has experties in coding or architecting in the cloud. I am fairly new to this space and I am looking to be a spong for knowledge and to also build technical acumen in the cloud space.
- 📫 How to reach me, I am reachable on GitHub. Just drop me a message.
